# Session 1

## Tickets of Destiny ðŸš‚
Fear: 3

### Opening Scene

We punch the three tickets of our pioneering heroes as the journey begins.

- **Nyx Fairweather** a _Faerie Warrior_ played by N
- **Clint Brook** a _Human Ranger_ player by T
- **Charlotte** a _Human Ranger_ played by J

The scene opens with our heroes enjoying drinks aboard the liquor coach of a train heading to [Wyllin's Gulch].  Our heroes have received a "lucrative" business oppurtunity by the marshal of Wyllin's Gulch - [Jessup Buchanan].

They eye three interesting characters.

- [Three orcs]
- [Siegfried Dravik]
- [Marsha Ava Tudor]

Marsha enters and begins drinking at the bar while the Charlotte feels the stare of the strange goggled man Siegfried.  Clint orders two drinks that are delivered by Marsha.  She attempts to have a light conversation with the heroes and then leaves.  Clint delivers a drink to Siefgfried and they introduce themselves, Clint inquires about Siegfried's attention and Siegfriend quietly says, "Your friend is very hairy".

Secretly, Charlotte using her Arcane Sense*, detects the magical goggles worn by Siegfried.

*This is a Sorcerer Class Feature

## Wyllin's Gulch

After time passes, the train rounds [Murdock's Bend] and the heroes disembark unto the [Train Station] and meet a Firbolg named George.  As George leads the party to the [Town Hall], he accidentally inquires about the heroes job of slaying the Colossus and Charlotte becomes irate.  Not wanting to be embarrassed She asks George to tell Jessup that they are not attending the town hall meeting without first speaking to Jessup.  Upon arriving at the Town Hall, Charlotte repeats her concerns and asks George to retrieve Jessup so they may talk outside.

After waiting some time unsuccessfully, Charlotte suggests they wait at the VIP section of the [Saloon] where Jessup is known to spend time.

## The train explosion incident

Train Clock: 6

While waiting, the heroes hear a distant explosion.  As they begin to investigate, they identify a dust cloud in the direction of the train station.  As the party makes their way to the train station, they are interrupted at the train station where a fire-wagon is trying to get through a large crowd to the train station.  While Nyx and Clint somewhat successfully guide the fire-wagon, Charlotte finds Jessup who rushes away on "important business" asking to meet at the saloon after the heroes help at the train station.

Upon arriving at the train station, the heroes see a half destroyed Train Station office/building and the cargo wagons behind their coach blown up.  As the heroes begin helping, everyone is stunned to hear an approaching train in the distance.  Two train officials begin looking for an emergency flare gun in the wreckage of the train station.

- **Nyx** finds a stray Bowler hat<critical /> that seemingly belongs to one of the Three Orcs.  He then begins flying towards the oncoming traing and is hampered by the dust cloud caused by the initial explosion.
- **Clint** begins looking through the wreckage but is hindered by an additional collapse of the train station building.
- **Charlotte** _secretly_ uses her water elemental magic to cause rain to put out the fires and help clear the dust cloud.  Additionally she casts Minor Illusion fireworks in an attempt to warn the oncoming train.

As Clint searches through the rubble again, he finds the Flair ammo, but no gun.  Thinking fast he attempts to throw a flair and shoot it.  As it lights, giant fireworks fly and explode in the sky (this provide distraction from Charlotte).

As the rain clears the dust cloud Nyx is now visible and gets the oncoming train conductor's attention as fireworks explode behind and above him.

\* *At this point, the Train Clock is at 2 and the GM spends a Fear to reduce the Train Clock to 1--Just like in the movies!!*

The oncoming train successfully brakes and everyone breathes a sigh of relief.  The heroes return to the Saloon as Clint is named the [Hero of Murdock's Bend]
