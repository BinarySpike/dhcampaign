# Session 2 - A Colossus Falls

Fear: 2

[[toc]]

## Opening Scene

Our heroes are Level 1.

**Nyx Fairweather** a _Faerie Warrior_ played by N
**Clint Brook** a _Human Ranger_ Played by T
**Cer Rantix (Charlotte)** a _Simian/Tiefling Sorcerer_ played by J
**Corvaud** a _Skykin Witch_ played by L

#### Errata from Session 1
_During the investigation of the quarry's compound, it was intended that the players find a letter addressed to Garrett Cockburn.  I did not remember to communicate or print the letter until after Session 1.  I will provide it below_

> My Dearest Garrett,

> I am infinitely grateful for your condolences on my late husband.  His passing left a gaping wound in my heart that I feared would never heal.  It’s true! Sympathy has its uses, and I have been most careful to collect every ounce of it.  Yes, it has left the household blind; none dare question how I allocate what is mine.  Every ledger I sign, every tithe I divert, draws the family’s wealth closer to our true ambitions.  I sometimes question whether love exists at all, or whether it is only the mask I wear as I bury one husband after another.

> I have heard the whispers carried on frightened tongues—of colossal shapes stirring in the drylands, of titans rising from the earth itself. The fools call them omens, yet I know well whose hand guides them. Your artistry leaves its mark too boldly for me to mistake it. Take comfort, dear brother, for I shall soon join you.

> With Love,

>    Catherine Cockburn

The scene opens with the lights of morning beginning to break as our first three heroes shocked by the presence of a colossus with a giant mesa on it's back.  They quickly decide it will take the same amount of time to grab their mounts versus travel on foot to the colossus.  Imagining the so-called reward that [Jessup] was offering them, they began traveling to the colossus.

## Attack on (a) Titan
From east of the colossus, the players see a dust cloud and several tribal Firbolg's on mounts, yelling a war cry and riding toward the colossus at a great speed.  Accompanying them is a Skykin on a large Elk mount.

The war party is slightly closer to the colossus and the first three heroes are traveling at an average pace (multiple failed group agility roles) the war party reaches the colossus first.

The Skykin launches a smokey Blightning and misses, causing a rock slide off the colossus to strike the leading Firbolg Yuma.  The second Firbolg stands on his mount, pulls out climbing hooks and jumps on the colossus's leg as the Skykin uses his gust ability and accidentally strikes the climbing Firbolg in mid-air, knocking them both to the grounds.  The colossus then misses to kick either ally.

It's at this point that the first three heroes arrive at the colossus.

They begin firing upon the hind legs of the colossus and trading short and terse introductions with the Skykin.  Once damaged enough, one of the legs cracks and essentia-like energy spreads through the leg.

Cer Rantix keeps distracting the colossus with (TODO FIX) minor illusion

Nyx and Clint keep firing on the legs with their rifles, and Clint slowly applies enough stress to max out the colossus's stress.

Corvaud keeps casting Blighting and eventually casts Hex on the colossus's torso.

The heroes finally take out the second leg and shortly after, another one of Corvaud's Blightning misses and buries him and two Firbolg ally's in rubble.  Corvaud is able to escape, but neither Firbolg is able to escape before the colossus steps on the rubble covering them.

The colossus increasingly rapidly strikes the heroes with his remaining arms and peck attacks.

Cer Rantix climbs onto the colossus's arm, only to narrowly miss being grabbed and shaken off.  He climbs to the torso and jumps off causing the colossus to turn around launching a devastating chain of peck attacks on Corvaud and Nyx.

## Almost Dead

The colossus then pecks and punches Cer Rantix, nearly killing him‼️ Cer Rantix takes the Avoid Death death move, rolling an 11 on his Hope die to avoid gaining a scar.

The fighting continues until Nyx (Or Clint??) marks the final two hitpoints on the torso.

Upon downing the colossus, the heroes head to Cer Rantix's body as Clint investigates the blue glow from the colossus's head.  Upon finding it and almost getting his arm taken off, he shoots the crystal, executing the colossus.  Upon extracting the essentia pearl, a vision is shared with all the players.

> You awake to see your left arm covered in scaly stone, draped by your full-length fur cloak.  You reach up with your regular fleshy right arm and call, "Ikeri come! We have been summoned to the whispering pool by the mad god"
> A small simian creature with a bird head jumps from a nearby branch and lands on your hand.  He represents the Colossus you just defeated.  To which you deposit him on your right shoulder.
> As you stand, your head and sight clears the top of the tree line and you begin walking forward—uprooting any trees you bump into.

## Level 2 Baby!

All the player characters, including Cer Rantix, awake and recover the unconscious Firbolg Yuma.  During this, Cer Rantix and Corvaud spot a lone rider, relaxing on his mount, on top of the eastern hill.  As the sun rises above the lone rider, he notices Corvaud's and Cer Rantix's attention and leaves.  Nyx attempts to track him unsuccessfully.

Corvaud asks the plants around him information on the rider, as he listens to the plants gossip, he hears talk about "The number one".  During the parties much needed long rest, Corvaud communes and asks the spirits who the rider was, he gets the flavor of gunpowder/gunshot/sulfur.

The party uneventfully heads back to Wyllin's Gulch, as they arrive, they see a less than bustling city before they find the saloon.  Nyx and Clint enter the saloon and find Siegfried Dravik playing cards at a table, and looks like he's doing well.

Corvaud and Cer Rantix remain outside to tend to Yuma while the bar wench Lorraine leaves to find Jessup.  Another wench, Katie, retrieves the "Wake Up Stuff" and is able to revive Yuma.  Corvaud relays to Yuma their parties outcome while Jessup arrives.

Nyx watches as Siegfried barely outwits one of his opponents for all his money.  It's clear Siegfried is somehow cheating—possibly with his magical goggle—but doesn't seem to understand the strategy of the game to maximize his profits.

Jessup, giddy at what seems like good news, collects the heroes and heads to his VIP booth.  As the heroes explain what happen, a sharp, but plainly dressed middle-aged man enters the saloon and introduces himself to the party as [Maxwell "Max" Holt].

Maxwell scoots into the booth with everyone and clearly knows more than Jessup.  As the heroes finish updating Jessup a commotion appears near the entrance to the saloon.

A crazed man approaches the booth while Corvaud and Cer Rantix attempt to deter him with Voice of Dread, Minor Illusion, and Midnight Spirit.  As two "guards" appear to stand and a voice tells him to stop, he tries to burst past them and and confront Maxwell and the party.

The man claims that he can now fight Maxwell to which Maxwell tries to explain that he is retired.  The man denies that this is allowed and demands a fight.  Maxwell then begins to describe the rituals on showdown gunfight dueling and that the man, [Agnill Purvel], has not shown himself capable to Maxwell.  The man claims to be the fastest gun in the Cockburn Company—The bandits—and that should be enough.

At this, Maxwell introduces all the heroes
- Corvaud, able to speak to the spirits of great gunman of the past, he has has been taught deep secrets of gun-fighting, able to kill his enemies in unimaginable ways.
- Cer Rantix, an international spy, able to blend in anywhere, as if he was lifted directly out of an "Agatha Hagatha" book. _(Cer Rantix was very annoyed that Maxwell was talking about him)_
- Clint Brooke, a champion from beyond the Drylands, known as the Hero of Murdoch's Bend, who saved many lives, has come to the drylands to seek fame, fortune, and a truly challenging fight.
- Nyx Fairweather, a prince Faerie from the Drylands.  As a man in a matriarchal society, undefeated in his own hive, he traveled the world defeating all his enemies.  He has now returned to take his rightful place.

He then asks the heroes for a volunteer, so that "Mr. Purvel" may prove himself.  Nyx gladly volunteers with the approval of the group.

Jessup, who is very concerned, quietly asks Cer Rantix again to explain what happened at the Quarry.

As Maxwell leads Nyx outside, he profusely thanks him, explaining that Maxwell is retired from guns and shooting.

End.

Fear: 7
