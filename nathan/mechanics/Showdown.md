# Showdown ðŸ¤ ðŸ’¥ðŸ¤ 

When two characters need to resolve a dispute, they may do so with their guns in a showdown.

When the stakes are high, all players will make a duality role and work with the GM to describe how their roll affects the scene.  Optionally, rolls with hope will give the GM a temporary hope that they can use on allies.

Once the scene has been set, or the stakes are low, the two characters will begin the showdown.

First, each dueling character chooses to shoot first, regular or last.

- Choosing to shoot first gives advantage to your agility/finesse roll but disadvantage to your attack roll
- Choosing to shoot regular gives no bonuses
- Choosing to shoot last gives you disadvantage to your agility/finesse roll but advantage to your attack roll

Then, each character will make their rolls.

- Finesse/Agility to identify who shoots first
- An attack roll to see if you hit
- Damage roll to see how much damage you do

> It's not that hard, once your opponent draws his weapon, you just shoot him in the head before he shoots you -_Maxwell "Max" Holt_
